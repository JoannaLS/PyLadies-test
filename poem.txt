Here lies our land: every airt
Beneath swift clouds, glad glints of sun,
Belonging to none but itself.

We are mere transients, who sing
Its westlin’ flowers and fernie braes,
Northern lights and siller tides,

Small folk playing our part.
‘Come all ye’, the rocknroll says,
You win me, who take me most to heart.
